# I'm Nomagno, an aspiring developer and amateur musician
- I am the author of the long-term project Halfive, aiming to make an engine and ecosystem for a 2D racing game entirely in freestanding C
- I am the author of NDS-NetworkedInput, an original application server written in C to control your computer with your DS or 3DS system (plus a client forked from Louisvh's NDS-controller)
- I have some experience contributing to SuperTuxKart, specially to lead maintainer Alayan's in-development future 2.0 branch (additionally, I am the author of the tyre degradation mod)
- I maintained Teloren (A terminal client to FOSS open-world RPG "Veloren", by zesterer, with both Teloren and Veloren being written in Rust) for around three months over on GitLab and added a few significant features like group invitation support and basic inventory support.
- I produced the score for an upcoming animated short by a friend.
