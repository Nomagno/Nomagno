# I'm Nomagno, a Computer Science student and amateur musician
- I am the author of the long-term WIP project Halfive, aiming to make an engine and ecosystem for a 2D racing game entirely in freestanding C, including the physics engine and renderer
- I am the author of NDS-NetworkedInput, an original application server written in C to control your computer with your DS or 3DS system (plus a client forked from Louisvh's NDS-controller)
- I have some experience contributing to SuperTuxKart, specially to lead maintainer Alayan's in-development future 2.0 branch. Additionally, I am the author of the tyre degradation mod, which recently turned into a full-blown hard-fork of the 2.0 branch with its own game design aspirations. It would not be an understatement to say this new Tyre Mod Edition is a very big scope project in the Open Source Racing Game scene. It has full fuel, tyre, pit stop, and online support, and in collaboration with kimden's command manager network mod overall contains more code changes than the entirety of the rest of the main STK project in the last few years.
- I maintained Teloren (A terminal client to FOSS open-world RPG "Veloren", by zesterer, with both Teloren and Veloren being written in Rust) for around three months over on GitLab and added a few significant features like group invitation support and basic inventory support.
- I have experience to varying degrees with C, C++, Rust, Python, Scheme, JavaScript, Bash, and GDScript (Godot development in general).
- I composed and produced the score for an upcoming animated short by a friend.
